### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I am a Master's student pursuing Computer Science at the University of Southern California. I am deeply passionate about building Software Development, Machine Learning and AI projects to eradicate the challenges faced by people and make their lives much easier and better.

I am a problem solver, a curious thinker, and a team player who loves to contribute in open source, share innovative ideas, works hard to figure out the potential solution and collaborate in diverse teams to make the project the best it can be.
